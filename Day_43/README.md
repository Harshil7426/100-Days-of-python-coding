## ðŸ‘‰ Day 43 Challenge

# ðŸ‘‰ Mecca Your Nan Very Happy
Today's challenge is to create a bingo card. Oh yes, because programming's not just for you hip, young cats. ðŸ˜†

Anyway, your challenge is to enable "gambling for the elderly" (aka Bingo), and you'll achieve it like this:

1. Randomly generate a series of numbers between 0 and 90.
2. Allocate each number to a place in a 2D list.
3. The numbers should be in numerical order, left to right.
4. Numbers should not be repeated.
5. The center square should not contain a number. It should contain the word 'BINGO!'.
6. When the program is run, the bingo card should be displayed on screen.
