## ğŸ‘‰ Day 42 Challenge
# "Some trainers have no fear. To them, this is just one more challenge".

- Create a dictionary to store the details of your, ahem, MokÃ©Beast.
- Ask the user to input the following details: name, type (earth, fire, air, water or spirit), special move, starting HP and starting MP. For now we're just taking in one set of values for one beast.
- Output the beast's details.
- Check the beast's type and change the color of the text accordingly. Fire is red, water is blue, air is white. You decide on the others.
- ğŸ¥³ Extra points for getting all the inputs with just one input command and the split function.
