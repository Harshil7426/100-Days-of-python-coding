## ðŸ‘‰ Day 56 Challenge
# CSV and OS
I've included a csv file ('100MostStreamedSongs.csv') in this repl that contains data from a music streaming service.

Your program should:

- Read in the data.
- Categorize the songs by artist, like this:
    - Create one empty folder per artist.
    - Create one blank text file per song by that artist in the relevant - - - folder. The file name of the text file should be the name of the song.
