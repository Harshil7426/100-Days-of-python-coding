## 👉 Day 14 Challenge

# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 🪨📄✂️

## 2 Player 🪨📄✂️

Today, you are going to build a rock, paper, scissors game.

Start with this code below to ensure that whenever you use input, each player cannot see what the other player typed in 😉:

```python
from getpass import getpass as input

For this version, you have two players. Player 1 and Player 2.
You will need to create if statements (and probably nesting) to decide who has won, lost or if the game is a tie.
Make it fun and add emojis or epic comments as your players battle it out.
Keep it simple for you. Dont expect the user to type in the words rock, paper, scissors. Instead, encourage them to use R, P, or S.
