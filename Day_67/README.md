## ðŸ‘‰ Day 67 Challenge
I've provided you with a folder called "Guess Who" containing images of 4 people.

Your program should:

- Prompt the user to input a name.
- If the user inputs 'Charlotte', 'Gerald', 'Kate' or 'Mo', then their image should load.
- Otherwise an 'image not found' message should display.
