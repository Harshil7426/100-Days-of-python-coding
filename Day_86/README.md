## ðŸ‘‰ Day 86 Challenge
Today's challenge is to build a fully functional blog engine.

- Create a website with a 'login page'.

- The login should work for one user only - you.

- If you are logged in, you will see:

    - A list of existing posts
    - A way to add new posts (a text box with a submit button.) Submit adds the post to your blog using Replit db.
- If you aren't logged in, you will see the blog entries (most recent first) on one continuous page.

- This feed page will also have a 'login' button.
