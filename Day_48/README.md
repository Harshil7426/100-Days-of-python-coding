## ðŸ‘‰ Day 48 Challenge
# Today's challenge is to create a high score table.

### Your program should:

- Ask the user to input their three letter initials and score (out of about 100,000).
- Save both those values into a file called 'high.score'.
- This should use append mode. If the file doesn't exist, it should be - - created. If it does, the score should be added to the end.
- Each new entry score should go on a new line as initials space score. Then start a new line for the next entry.
- Add 2-3 scores for testing in a loop.
- The loop should ask the user if they've finished entering data and stop if they have.
