## ðŸ‘‰ Day 26 Challenge
# ðŸŽµ MyPOD Music Player
Play a song from this repl and build a menu to go with it. Make it look like an iPod!

When you run the code below, it should open the Output tool which will have a checkbox with a headphones icon in the bottom right corner. Select this checkbox to hear the sound. (It may be behind the video.)

Use a while true loop to create a title for a music player.
Allow the user to select to play a song and use subroutine called 'play' when they select the song.
Give the user the option to exit the program.
The title should pop up and pause along with the menu options.
If the user chooses anything else, start again by clearing the screen.
