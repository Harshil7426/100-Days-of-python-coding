## ðŸ‘‰ Day 53 Challenge
# Your video game inventory system should:

- Have a menu that allows the user to:
    - Add
    - View
    - Remove
- Adding an item saves it to a file using captalize mode. Duplicates are allowed.
- Removing an item deletes it from the file.
- View is trickier. It should output the name of the item and tell you how many of those items you have.
- Use auto-save and auto-load with try... except.
