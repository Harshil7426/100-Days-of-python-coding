## ðŸ‘‰ Day 55 Challenge
# Files
Back the 'f' up everybody!

'f' is short for 'file', of course. What did you think I meant?

Get your minds out of the gutter, go back and get your auto save/load to do list from Day 51 and use it here.

- Your program should:

    - Create a backup folder.
    - Create a random filename.
    - Save a copy of the data to that file.
    - This should all happen before the auto save.
