## ðŸ‘‰ Day 100 Challenge
Today's challenge is to create a super useful price scraper.

NOTE: Amazon is really good at spotting scrapers, so you'll soon be noticed and your IP will be blocked. Try a different product website instead.

Also, if you want this to constantly be on, you'll need a paid for service from Replit.

Your code should:

- Use a dictionary to store a product's current price and a price at which you'd be willing to buy them.
- Every day, scrape the page for price changes.
- If the price has changed and it's under your 'I'd buy that for a dollar' price, automate an email to be sent to yourself.
- The email should contain:
    - A link to the product
    - A reminder of your desired price
    - The current price
