## ðŸ‘‰ Day 57 Challenge
# Try to use recursion to build a factorial program.

Yep, it's a math challenge. Recursion is often good for this type of problem.

It could be a real head scratcher, so don't be afraid to use 100 Days of Code Community or the Discord channel for help.

A factorial is the product of all the numbers up to a value, starting from 1.

For example, factorial 5 would be 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

- Write a function that:
    Starts at the highest number.
    Multiplies that by factorial of itself minus one
    Terminates when it reaches 1 and returns 1
    Outputs the factorial.
