## ðŸ‘‰ Day 78 Challenge
ðŸ‘‰ Your program should:

- Have a template for the page accessible by going to URL/dayNumber (eg myLovelyWebsite/78)

- Each page should have:

    - The day number in a title
    - A link to your repl
    - Your reflections in the text
    - Each page should be nicely styled with CSS.

- If I go to the page in a browser, and change the number after the / it should load the relevant page.
