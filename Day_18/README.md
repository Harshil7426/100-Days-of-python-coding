## ðŸ‘‰ Day 18 Challenge
# We are going to build a "Guess the Number" guessing game.

- You are going to use a while loop and some of the concepts from the past few days.

- Start by picking a number between 0 and 1,000,000. This will be your first variable.
- Create a while loop to keep asking the user to guess your number.

- If they are too low, tell them "too low." If they guess too high tell, them "too high."
- If the user guesses correctly, tell them they are a winner (maybe add a fun emoji too!)
- Count the number of attempts it took for the user to guess number. Make sure you only show that after they get the answer correct.
- Extra challenge: If the user types a negative number, exit program.
