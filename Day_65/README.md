## ðŸ‘‰ Day 65 Challenge
Today is a project day! You're going to use what you've learned about OOP (on Day 64) to store characters for my video game.

- My game needs to have a character with a name, health and magic points.
- It needs these values setup when it is initialized.
- t needs a method to output this data.
- There should be a sub-class 'player' which inherits from character and also has a number of lives.
- Player should also have an 'am I alive?' method which checks the player status and reports back yes or no.
- There should also be an 'enemy' sub-class with additional 'type' and 'strength'.
- 'enemy' should have two sub-classes:
    - 'orc' with a 'speed' attribute.
    - 'vampire' with a 'day/night' tracker
- Instantiate one player, two vampires and three orcs. You choose their names.
- Print out their values.
