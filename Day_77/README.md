## ðŸ‘‰ Day 77 Challenge
Today's challenge is to set up a simple template for a blog.

Your template should:

- Have a space for a heading
- Have a space for today's date
- Have a space for the text.
    - Now write two different blog entries and serve them on two different endpoints.
    - The blog entries should both use the same template, and have shortened redirects to their URLs.
