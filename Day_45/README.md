# Made it? Good! Let's get cracking.


### Have a menu that asks if you want to add, view, move or edit a 'to do'.

- If you choose 'add' then the system should:

    - Prompt you to input what the to do is, when it is due by and the priority (high, medium or low).
    - Add the 'to do' to the list.

- 'View' should give two options:

    - View all - shows all 'to dos' with a pretty print.
    - View priority - allows you to search for high, medium or low priority and only see matching tasks.

- 'Edit' allows you to change any of the information within one of the 'to dos'.

- 'Remove' lets you completely remove a 'to do' when it is 'to done'.
