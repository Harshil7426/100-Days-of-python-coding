## ðŸ‘‰ Day 61 Challenge
Someone is wrong on the Internet!
Today, we're going to fix the major malfunction with social media - other people and their stupid opinions- and create a Twitter for one!

I know you like to hear the sound of your own voice!

Your program should.

- Display a menu - Add or View tweets.

- 'Add' should:

    - Get the tweet input.
    - Store it to the database with the current timestamp as the key value.
- 'View' should:

    - Show the tweets in reverse chronological order.
    - Show 10 tweets at a time.
    - Prompt the user to show another 10 tweets (yes or no).
    - A 'no' choice goes back to the menu.
