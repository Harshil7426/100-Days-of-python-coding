# Python `if` Statements

`if` statements in Python are used to ask the program a question: **If a condition is true, then execute a specific block of code**. To compare two values, Python uses the double equals (`==`) operator. This checks if two things are exactly the same.

## Syntax: 
```python
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if the condition is true
```

### Why Doesn't Anything Print?

To ensure something happens after the `if` condition is met, you need to write the code to be executed on the next line, indented correctly. This is crucial to make sure the code is part of the `if` block.

For example:
```python
if 5 == 5:
    print("This will print because 5 equals 5")
```

Indentation is important in Python, and some editors (like Replit) auto-indent for you. However, it's important to always check that your code is properly aligned.

## What is `else`?

The `else` statement comes into play when the condition in the `if` statement is not met. In that case, the code inside the `else` block is executed. The `else` block must be on the same indentation level as the `if` statement.

Example:
```python
if 5 == 6:
    print("This won't print because 5 is not equal to 6")
else:
    print("This will print because the condition in the if statement was false")
```

### Key Points:
- `if` checks a condition.
- `else` provides an alternative when the `if` condition is false.
- Indentation is critical in Python to define code blocks.

With these basic structures, you can begin to control the flow of your programs in Python!
