## ðŸ‘‰ Day 91 Challenge
Today's challenge is to build a program from this basic principle that will:

- Give you a random joke.
- Ask if you want to save it.
- If you do, it should:
    - Save the joke ID number to a replit db
- Ask the user if they want to see the saved jokes and output the contents of the database.
