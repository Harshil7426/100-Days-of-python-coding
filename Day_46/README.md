## üëâ Day 46 Challenge
# 2D Dictionaries
Today, you're going to program a full on Mok√©beast Mok√©dex. Yep, think we're getting away with it so far...

Don't forget, you can reuse your code from Day 42 here.

- Your Mok√©dex should:
    - Store multiple Mok√©beasts using a loop.
    - Get user input of the beasts' details.
    - Add the details to a 2D dictionary.
    - Repeat until the user wants to stop.
    - Output the full Mok√©dex using a prettyPrint() function.
