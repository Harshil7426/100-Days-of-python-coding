## ðŸ‘‰ Day 88 Challenge
Today's challenge is to adapt your blog engine again.

Your program should:

- Allow your normal blog page to be visible to anyone, regardless of login status.
- If a user logs in, and it's you, take them to the admin page.
- If a user logs in, and it's not you, tell them off for being naughty!
