# 100 Days of Code - Python

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey! ðŸŽ‰

## About
This repository serves as a personal log of my 100-day commitment to learning and advancing my Python programming skills. Over the next 100 days, I will work on a variety of projects, solve coding challenges, and continually document my progress to keep myself accountable.

> **Note:** Originally inspired by the Replit 100 Days of Code (Python) challenge. Due to limitations on the number of free repls on Replit, I'm using GitHub to maintain my code and progress.

## Objectives
- **Strengthen Python skills**: By coding daily, I aim to become more proficient in Python programming.
- **Master core concepts**: Focus on solidifying key Python concepts and principles.
- **Hands-on learning**: Complete projects and exercises that reinforce what Iâ€™ve learned.
- **Document progress**: Maintain a daily log of my learning, insights, and challenges faced throughout the process.

## Challenge Guidelines
- **Code every day**: Dedicate a minimum of 1 hour daily to writing Python code.
- **Daily logs**: After each session, I'll document what I learned, any obstacles I encountered, and how I resolved them.
- **Commit to GitHub**: All code and project work will be regularly pushed to this repository to track my progress.
- **Build real-world projects**: Iâ€™ll apply my growing knowledge through the creation of practical, real-world Python projects.

Iâ€™m excited to start this journey and see where it takes me! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
