## ðŸ‘‰ Day 99 Challenge
Today's challenge is to create a combo scraper: emailer and scheduler.

Your program should:

- Scrape the Replit Community Hub for events and put them into a list.
- Filter the events by topics that interest you (remember how we filtered news articles from hacker news?)
- Schedule the scrape for every 6 hours.
- If an event of interest is scraped, email yourself (or a friend) with a hyperlink to the event.
- Only email any new events.
