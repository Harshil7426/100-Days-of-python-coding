## ðŸ‘‰ Day 44 Challenge
# Bingo
- It's time for more bingo! You can reuse your code from day 43, but this time add the following features:

* Repeatedly ask the user what number comes up next.
* Check the bingo card to see if the number picked matches one on the card.
* If the bingo card is all 'X's, then the user has won.

Example:
```
2	4	X
X	BG	46
61	68	X

X	X	X	
X	BG	X	
X	68	X	

Next Number: 68
You have won
