**Subroutine:**

So far, when we wanted to repeat code, we have had to use loops or copy and paste code.

What if I told you there was a way to use code or call it and use it anytime anywhere??

That is a subroutine!!

A subroutine tells the computer that a piece of code exists and to go run that code again and again whenever needed, which allows for cleaner, reusable, and more efficient code.
