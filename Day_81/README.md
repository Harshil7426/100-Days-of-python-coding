## ðŸ‘‰ Day 81 Challenge
Today's challenge is to build the legendary I'm not a robot program.

It should work like this:

- Your program should ask some fiendishly tricky questions that might help identify a possible robot attempting to login. Questions like:
    - Are you made of metal?
    - Were you constructed by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation?
    - Do you dream of being ED-209 when you grow up?
    - And so on......
- Ask at least 3 questions.
- Check for any giveaway answers.
- One question should be a yes/no with a radio button answer format.
- One question should be free text.
- One question should be a drop down.
- The user should get a 'You're a robot' or 'Not a robot' page.
