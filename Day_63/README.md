## ðŸ‘‰ Day 63 Challenge
# Today's challenge is to become your own librarian. Oook!

In the real world, programmers usually keep a library of their most useful subroutines just like this. You're going to curate your own library with these subroutines.

- Go back through your programs and choose some subroutines that you've used a lot. Perhaps it was your dice roller. Could be your prettyPrint. Maybe it was your 'generate random baldy insult' subroutine. Whatever. Find them.
- Create a new file that contains all your best subroutines.
- Import this file into your main.py and call a few to show that it works.
