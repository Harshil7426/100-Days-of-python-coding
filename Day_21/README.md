## ðŸ‘‰ Day 21 Challenge
# Math Game
### Test your family and friends on their multiplication knowledge (or just be really mean to people you know and ask them to work out their multiplication tables for 5,474,000,000....)

- Prompt the user by asking for a multiplication table for the number of their choice.
- Generate the multiplication table for 1 to 10 times that number and ask each math fact as a question (psst...that's a hint).
- If the user gets the math correct, award them a point. If they get it wrong, do not give them any points.
- At the end of the 10 rounds, show the user their score out of 10 for how many math facts they got correct.
- Why not give users an emoji if they get all 10 math facts correct?
