## ðŸ‘‰ Day 83 Challenge
Today's challenge is to add custom themes to your blogging engine code from Day 77.

- Go and get your code from Day 77. This should include the template html file.
- Add get requests to it, so that if I pass in the variable theme and a theme name I can change the theme to one of at least two different options.
- Each theme should be visually different in at least one color, but go to town if you're feeling creative.
- If I don't pass in any variables, the system should load the default theme.
