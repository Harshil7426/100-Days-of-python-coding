ðŸ‘‰ Day 69 Challenge
Today's challenge is to create your own visual novel. This is a type of 'choose your own adventure' video game that will show images and a bit of text and let you make decisions that influence what will be displayed next.

Your novel should be quite simple, with only two decisions:

- Start with a picture, short text introduction and two options.
- Allow the user to click buttons to choose their option.
- Display the correct branch, story image & text, and further option buttons based on their choice.
- From one branch both of the second options should lead to the same unhappy ending (not nice, but it'll save you time).
- The ending should be an image, some text and a 'start again' button that takes you back to page 1.
- The second branch should have two options, one that leads to a good ending, and one to a bad. Both of these should also have a 'start again' button.
