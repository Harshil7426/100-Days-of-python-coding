## ðŸ‘‰ Day 64 Challenge
In today's project, create classes to represent jobs.

* Your program should

- Create a generic 'job' class.
- The init method will store the details for name, salary and hours worked.
- 'job' will have another method that prints those details nicely.
- Create two sub-classes from job: 'doctor' and 'teacher'
- The 'doctor' subclass should also include 'speciality' and 'years of experience'.
- The 'teacher' subclass should also include 'subject' and 'position'.
- The print functions for each sub-class should print this extra data.
- Instantiate a lawyer, a computer science teacher, and a pediatric doctor (this is a doctor for children) with 7 years of experience.
- Output the information for each job.
