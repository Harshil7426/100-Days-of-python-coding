## ðŸ‘‰ Day 85 Challenge
Today's challenge is to extend your login system from yesterday.

Extend it so:

- It uses the 'sessions' value to store the login information to a sessions dictionary on the user's computer.
- Add a check to see if the sessions data has been set for the username to every page.
- If it hasn't, kick the user back to the login screen.
- Add a 'logout' button that clears the session data and kicks back to the login page.
- The user shouldn't be able to go to any page (apart from 'login' unless they are logged in.)
